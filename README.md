**Hello!**

I'm Mateusz Bis, a dedicated and versatile **Full Stack Software Engineer** with a robust background in both development and design.

I have been immersed in the tech world since **2019** when back in High School I created [Redinn Labs](https://redinnlabs.com) , a **web agency** which to this day puts performance and quality at the forefront of every project. It has enabled me to gain experience across a variety of domains, including the **development of websites**, **interactive web applications**, **Android apps**, **backend microservices**, and the utilization of **AWS & Google Cloud services**. With this skillset, I have the means to approach challenges with a comprehensive perspective, ensuring that each solution is efficient, scalable, and aligned with client needs.

Moreover, my journey in software development has been complemented by **various certifications** visible on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-bis-185bb1230/), with the most important being the [Google UX Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design), achieved in **2022**, which has enhanced my ability to craft user-centric digital experiences that are both functional and intuitive.

**Since March 2024** I've been honing my skills through an [internship at Optima Medical Group](https://optimamedical.pl) , where I am contributing to the **development of healthcare solutions** on their websites. In addition, **since January 2022** I've been the leader of the software development team at a [student startup Poznaj GÃ³ry](https://poznajgory.pl) , which aims to create **AI Trip Planner**, a cloud service that will allow people to plan holidays to the mountains in minutes rather than hours. This venture not only allows me to apply my technical expertise but also fuels my passion for outdoor exploration and community engagement.

I am also a dedicated student of [Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology](https://informatyka.agh.edu.pl/en/) in Cracow, Poland, where I have been studying since **October, 2023**. My academic pursuits provide a strong theoretical foundation that complements my practical experience, allowing me to stay abreast of the latest advancements in the field.

With a **proficient command of English**, I excel in collaborating with international teams and clients, ensuring clear and effective communication. My blend of technical prowess, design skills, and entrepreneurial spirit positions me uniquely in the tech landscape, enabling me to deliver exceptional results in every endeavor.

After work I love running (as my profile picture suggests), inline & ice skating, skiing, mountain biking, flying FPV drones and photography. As of right now I am interested in learning machine learning and [becoming a member of the mountain volunteer rescue service](https://www.gopr.pl/)

I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am always eager to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of technology and design.

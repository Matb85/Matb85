**Hello!**

I'm Mateusz Bis, a dedicated and versatile **Full Stack Software Engineer** with a robust background in both development and design.

I have been immersed in the tech world since **2019**, I am a keen runner (as my profile picture suggests), in my free time I also practice inline & ice skating, skiing, mountain biking, flying FPV drones and photography. As of right now I am interested in [becoming a member of the mountain volunteer rescue service](https://www.gopr.pl/)

I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am always eager to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of technology and design. Please [feel invited to visit my web portfolio](https://matb85.github.io/#selected-works) to look at some of my work and [browse my certificates here](https://github.com/Matb85/matb85.github.io/tree/master/public/certificates).

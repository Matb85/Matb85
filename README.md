**Hello!**

I'm Mateusz Bis, a dedicated **Full Stack Software Engineer** since **2019** with a robust background in both development and design.

In my free time I love running (as my profile picture suggests), I also practice inline & ice skating, skiing, mountain biking and photographing. Additionaly, I'm a member of [the mountain volunteer rescue service](https://www.gopr.pl/), currently I'm training to become a certified volunteer mountain rescuer.

Feel invited to visit my [web portfolio](https://matb85.github.io/#selected-works), where I showcase some of my work. Also, feel free to browse my [certificates here](https://github.com/Matb85/matb85.github.io/tree/master/public/certificates).
